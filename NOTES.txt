Assumptions:

- Edit / Delete buttons for each product
- Used a datepicker to make date input easier, common date format
- Added some rudimentary form validation

Choices:

- react-bootstrap used for styling
- localStorage used for persistence (in place of server API)


Questions:

Q - Is my solution scalable?
A - Yes, although for a large number of products, performance would be a concern.  Adding pagination would help

Q - Is my solution maintainable?
A - Yes, adding new fields would be a trivial exercise.

Q - Potential pain points?
A - Using a route for the form could be seen as clunky, using a Modal would be a possible solution

Q - Architecturally sound?
A - Yes, Redux used for app state, state is not changed directly, containers are used to provide event dispatching, components are self contained and exhibit a top-down approach
